abstract = {Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a new challenge focusing on generalizing learned coordination skills to unseen partners. Existing methods train the ego agent with partners from pre-trained or evolving populations. The agent's ZSC capability is typically evaluated with a few evaluation partners, including human and agent, and reported by mean returns. Current evaluation methods for ZSC capability still need to improve in constructing diverse evaluation partners and comprehensively measuring the ZSC capability. We aim to create a reliable, comprehensive, and efficient evaluation method for ZSC capability. We formally define the ideal 'diversity-complete' evaluation partners and propose the best response (BR) diversity, which is the population diversity of the BRs to the partners, to approximate the ideal evaluation partners. We propose an evaluation workflow including 'diversity-complete' evaluation partners construction and a multi-dimensional metric, the Best Response Proximity (BR-Prox) metric. BR-Prox quantifies the ZSC capability as the performance similarity to each evaluation partner's approximate best response, demonstrating generalization capability and improvement potential. We re-evaluate strong ZSC methods in the Overcooked environment using the proposed evaluation workflow. Surprisingly, the results in some of the most used layouts fail to distinguish the performance of different ZSC methods. Moreover, the evaluated ZSC methods must produce more diverse and high-performing training partners. Our proposed evaluation workflow calls for a change in how we efficiently evaluate ZSC methods as a supplement to human evaluation.},

abstract = {Achieving coordination between humans and artificial intelligence in scenarios involving previously unencountered humans remains a substantial obstacle within Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination, which aims to develop AI agents capable of efficiently working alongside previously unknown human teammates. Traditional algorithms have aimed to collaborate with humans by optimizing fixed objectives within a population, fostering diversity in strategies and behaviors. However, these techniques may lead to learning loss and an inability to cooperate with specific strategies within the population, a phenomenon named cooperative incompatibility. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Cooperative Open-ended LEarning (COLE) framework, which formulates open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players using perspectives of graph theory to evaluate and pinpoint the cooperative capacity of each strategy. We put forth a practical algorithm incorporating insights from game theory and graph theory, e.g., Shapley Value and Centrality. We also show that COLE could effectively overcome the cooperative incompatibility from theoretical and empirical analysis. Subsequently, we created an online Overcooked human-AI experiment platform, the COLE platform, which enables easy customization of questionnaires, model weights, and other aspects. Utilizing the COLE platform, we enlist 130 participants for human experiments. Our findings reveal a preference for our approach over state-of-the-art methods using a variety of subjective metrics. Moreover, objective experimental outcomes in the Overcooked game environment indicate that our method surpasses existing ones when coordinating with previously unencountered AI agents and the human proxy model. },

abstract = {Zero-shot coordination in cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) remains a significant challenge, which means effectively coordinating with a wide range of unseen partners. Previous algorithms have attempted to address this challenge by optimizing fixed objectives within a population to improve strategy or behavior diversity. However, these approaches can result in a loss of learning and an inability to cooperate with certain strategies within the population, known as cooperative incompatibility. To address this issue, we propose the Cooperative Open-ended LEarning (COLE) framework, which constructs open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players from the perspective of graph theory to assess and identify the cooperative ability of each strategy. We further specify the framework and propose a practical algorithm that leverages knowledge from game theory and graph theory. Furthermore, an analysis of the learning process of the algorithm shows that it can efficiently overcome cooperative incompatibility. The experimental results in the Overcooked game environment demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when coordinating with different-level partners.

Researchers need to read a huge amount of literature to locate, extract and aggregate relevant results and data that are published and stored in PDF format for building a scientific database to support the big data-driven discovery. In this paper, based on the findings of a study about how geoscientists annotate literature and extract and aggregate data, we proposed GeoDeepShovel, a publicly available AI-assisted data extraction system to support their needs.

  abstract={Constructing a comprehensive, accurate, and useful scientific knowledge base is crucial for human researchers synthesizing scientific knowledge and for enabling Al-driven scientific discovery. However, the current process is difficult, error-prone, and laborious due to (1) the enormous amount of scientific literature available; (2) the highly-specialized scientific domains; (3) the diverse modalities of information (text, figure, table); and, (4) the silos of scientific knowledge in different publications with inconsistent formats and structures. Informed by a formative study and iterated with participatory design workshops, we designed and developed KnowledgeShovel, an Al-in-the-Loop document annotation system for researchers to construct scientific knowledge bases. The design of KnowledgeShovel introduces a multi-step multi-modal human-AI collaboration pipeline that aligns with users' existing workflows to improve data accuracy while reducing the human burden. A follow-up user evaluation with 7 geoscience researchers shows that KnowledgeShovel can enable efficient construction of scientific knowledge bases with satisfactory accuracy.},

abstract = {Neural networks have achieved great success in many tasks, including data classification and pattern recognition. However, how neural networks work and what representations they learn are still not fully understood. For any data sample fed into a neural network, we wondered how its corresponding vectors expanded by activated neurons change throughout the layers and why the final output vector could be classified or clustered. To formally answer these questions, we define the data sample outputs of each layer as activation vectors and the space expanded by them as the activation space. Then, we investigate the geometric structure of the high-dimensional activation spaces of neural networks by studying the geometric characters of the massive activation vectors through approximated convex hulls. We find that the different layers of neural networks have different roles, where the former and latter layers can disperse and gather data points, respectively. Moreover, we also propose a novel classification method based on the geometric structures of activation spaces, called nearest convex hull (NCH) classification, for the activation vectors in each layer of a neural network. The empirical results show that the geometric structure can indeed be utilized for classification and often outperforms original neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the relationship among the convex hulls of different classes could be a good metric to help us optimize neural networks in terms of over-fitting detection and network structure simplification.}

abstract = {Historical texts form the basis of the study of antiquities. In the case of Chinese historical texts different genres exist, e.g. chronological and biographical works etc. The contents of these texts normally consist of complex and interrelated information which covers long time period. Traditional history research relies heavily on information extraction and analysis by human researchers. With the recent development of the internet, data science and visualization technologies, digital history gradually attracts more and more attentions and in turn significantly impacts the field of historical study through altering the accessibility of the source materials, the narrative strategy and the analytical methodologies. This paper provides a system that enhances the Chinese historical research using word segmentation, texts analysis and visualization technologies. We can improve the workflow of traditional historical research via automatically detecting important keywords in Chinese historical texts and extracting, analyzing and visualizing the relations between a keyword and other words. This does not only accelerate the text based historical study but also to a great extent increase the scope of the search and analysis of the keywords in Chinese historical texts which used to be limited by the capacity of human researchers.},
