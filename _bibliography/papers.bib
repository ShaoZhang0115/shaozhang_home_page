abstract = {Historical texts form the basis of the study of antiquities. In the case of Chinese historical texts different genres exist, e.g. chronological and biographical works etc. The contents of these texts normally consist of complex and interrelated information which covers long time period. Traditional history research relies heavily on information extraction and analysis by human researchers. With the recent development of the internet, data science and visualization technologies, digital history gradually attracts more and more attentions and in turn significantly impacts the field of historical study through altering the accessibility of the source materials, the narrative strategy and the analytical methodologies. This paper provides a system that enhances the Chinese historical research using word segmentation, texts analysis and visualization technologies. We can improve the workflow of traditional historical research via automatically detecting important keywords in Chinese historical texts and extracting, analyzing and visualizing the relations between a keyword and other words. This does not only accelerate the text based historical study but also to a great extent increase the scope of the search and analysis of the keywords in Chinese historical texts which used to be limited by the capacity of human researchers.},

abstract = {Abstract With the rapid development of big data science, the research paradigm in the field of geosciences has also begun to shift to big data-driven scientific discovery. Researchers need to read a huge amount of literature to locate, extract and aggregate relevant results and data that are published and stored in PDF format for building a scientific database to support the big data-driven discovery. In this paper, based on the findings of a study about how geoscientists annotate literature and extract and aggregate data, we proposed GeoDeepShovel, a publicly available AI-assisted data extraction system to support their needs. GeoDeepShovel leverages state-of-the-art neural network models to support researcher(s) easily and accurately annotate papers (in the PDF format) and extract data from tables, figures, maps, etc., in a human–AI collaboration manner. As a part of the Deep-Time Digital Earth (DDE) program, GeoDeepShovel has been deployed for 8 months, and there are already 400 users from 44 geoscience research teams within the DDE program using it to construct scientific databases on a daily basis, and more than 240 projects and 50,000 documents have been processed for building scientific databases.},

abstract = {Neural networks have achieved great success in many tasks, including data classification and pattern recognition. However, how neural networks work and what representations they learn are still not fully understood. For any data sample fed into a neural network, we wondered how its corresponding vectors expanded by activated neurons change throughout the layers and why the final output vector could be classified or clustered. To formally answer these questions, we define the data sample outputs of each layer as activation vectors and the space expanded by them as the activation space. Then, we investigate the geometric structure of the high-dimensional activation spaces of neural networks by studying the geometric characters of the massive activation vectors through approximated convex hulls. We find that the different layers of neural networks have different roles, where the former and latter layers can disperse and gather data points, respectively. Moreover, we also propose a novel classification method based on the geometric structures of activation spaces, called nearest convex hull (NCH) classification, for the activation vectors in each layer of a neural network. The empirical results show that the geometric structure can indeed be utilized for classification and often outperforms original neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the relationship among the convex hulls of different classes could be a good metric to help us optimize neural networks in terms of over-fitting detection and network structure simplification.}
